What are Fibonacci numbers?
===========================

Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers defined by the two first terms :

.. math::

   f_0 &= 0\\
   f_1 &= 1\\

and for all :math:`n\geq 0` by the following recursion relation :

.. math::

   f_{n+1} &= f_{n+1} + f_{n}.

Here are the Fibonacci numbers for :math:`0\leq n \leq 10` :
