        Creates a Huffman tree consisting of either:
        - one leaf (in that case `symbol` and `occurrences` must be provided)
        - a node with two subtrees.

        :param symbol: The symbol to store in the leaf
        :type symbol: str
        :param occurrences: The number of occurrences of the given symbol
        :type occurrences: int

        :param right: The right subtree
        :type right: huffman_tree.HuffmanTree
        :UC: Either symbol and occurrences are given, or left and right.
        The number of occurrences must be positive.

        >>> HuffmanTree(left = HuffmanTree('a', 1), right = HuffmanTree('b', 1))
