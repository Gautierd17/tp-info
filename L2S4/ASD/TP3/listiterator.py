""":mod:`listiterator` module : list implementation with iterator interaction

Provides constructor, selectors and modifiers for mutable lists.
Lists of this module must be traversed via iterators.

An iterator for lists allows the programmer to traverse the list in
either direction and adding elements to the list during iteration.

An iterator has no current element; its cursor position always lies
between the element that would be returned by a call to :code:`previous` and
the element that would be returned by a call to `next`.

An iterator for a list of length n has n+1 possible cursor positions,
as illustrated by the carets (^) below:

.. code::

                      Element(0)   Element(1)   Element(2)   ... Element(n-1)
 cursor positions:  ^            ^            ^            ^                  ^
